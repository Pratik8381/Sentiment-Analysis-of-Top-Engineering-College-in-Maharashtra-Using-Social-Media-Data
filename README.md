# 📊 Sentiment Analysis of Top Engineering Colleges in Maharashtra Using Social Media Data

## 📝 Description

This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on the top engineering colleges in Maharashtra by leveraging social media data, such as tweets and posts. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, the project extracts and analyzes public opinions to determine the overall sentiment and perception of these institutions. The insights derived from this analysis can assist colleges in understanding their reputation, help students make informed decisions, and guide policymakers in addressing relevant issues.
